# food_app

*Progress is Paused*

Last updated 3/16/18

An application that would scrape the ingredients of a recipe and then retrieve its nutrional value. Project is on pause at the moment.

'recipe_scraper' contains the web scraping tools to scrape out the amount, units, and food items from a recipe website. Currently only set to work with https://www.allrecipes.com/

'nutrional_analysis' contains the scripts to process and analyze nutrional data provided by USDA. This would be later used to connect back to the recipes to find out the nutrional value.
