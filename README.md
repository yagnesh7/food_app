# food_app

*Project is on hold.*

Last updated 3/16/18

An application that would scrape the ingredients of a recipe and then retrieve its nutrional value. Project is on pause at the moment.

'recipe_scraper' contains the web scraping tools to scrape out the amount, units, and food items from a recipe website. Currently only set to work with https://www.allrecipes.com/

I take no ownership of the html files in this folder. They are html files from allrecipes and were used to help me debug locally.

'nutrional_analysis' contains the scripts to process and analyze nutrional data provided by USDA. This would be later used to connect back to the recipes to find out the nutrional value.

The nutrional data can be found here: https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/composition-foods-raw-processed-prepared-usda-national-nutrient-database-standard-reference-release-28-0
